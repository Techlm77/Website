I started developing my website in 2018 then the following year I went to Google Digital Garage for a couple of weeks 
to learn more about HTML and JavaScript. 

In September 2019 I started BTEC Level 1 IT/ICT at Gateshead College, I gained a distinction for developing a website. 
I continued at Gateshead College in September 2020 gaining BTEC Level 2 distinction + merit. As part of my Level 2, 
I was the only student who managed to create a digital portfolio from scratch without any additional tools/website e.g. wix.com, Google Site and weebly.com, 
I was asked by Gateshead College if my work could be shared on social media. 

In my spare time, I was learning more about math in programming for some of my projects like Maze game (https://techlm77.com/Custom Games/Maze/), Trigonometry and
a 3D car (https://techlm77.com/test.html) / (https://techlm77.com/3D-Objects/Car/3D-Car(all).html). 

The 3D car game (https://techlm77.com/test.html) is in very early development and it took time to create a way for the game engine to work because 
the 3D coordinates in CSS and JavaScript were difficult to figure out a way to make the car go forward then rotate whichever the user wanted to go.

For example some projects like TempleOS, 3D Car, Trigonometry are inspired by Terry A. Davis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_A._Davis).
